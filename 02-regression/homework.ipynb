    "### Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework, we will use the California Housing Prices from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a wget-able [link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexeygrigorev/datasets/master/housing.csv):\n",
    "\n",

    "The goal of this homework is to create a regression model for predicting housing prices (column `'median_house_value'`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### EDA\n",
    "\n",
    "* Load the data.\n",
    "* Look at the `median_house_value` variable. Does it have a long tail? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preparing the dataset \n",
    "\n",
    "For this homework, we only want to use a subset of data. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, keep only the records where `ocean_proximity` is either `'<1H OCEAN'` or `'INLAND'`\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, use only the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `'latitude'`,\n",
    "* `'longitude'`,\n",
    "* `'housing_median_age'`,\n",
    "* `'total_rooms'`,\n",
    "* `'total_bedrooms'`,\n",
    "* `'population'`,\n",

    "### Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "There's one feature with missing values. What is it?\n",
    "\n",
    "* `total_rooms`\n",
    "* `total_bedrooms`\n",
    "* `population`\n",
    "* `households`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "What's the median (50% percentile) for variable `'population'`?\n",
    "\n",
    "- 995\n",
    "- 1095\n",
    "- 1195\n",
    "- 1295\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prepare and split the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "* Shuffle the initial dataset, use seed `42`.\n",
    "* Split your data in train/val/test sets, with 60%/20%/20% distribution.\n",
    "* Apply the log transformation to the `median_house_value` variable using the `np.log1p()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "* We need to deal with missing values for the column from Q1.\n",
    "* We have two options: fill it with 0 or with the mean of this variable.\n",
    "* Try both options. For each, train a linear regression model without regularization using the code from the lessons.\n",
    "* For computing the mean, use the training only!\n",
    "* Use the validation dataset to evaluate the models and compare the RMSE of each option.\n",
    "* Round the RMSE scores to 2 decimal digits using `round(score, 2)`\n",
    "* Which option gives better RMSE?\n",
    "\n",
    "Options:\n",
    "\n",
    "- With 0\n",
    "- With mean\n",
    "- Both are equally good\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "* Now let's train a regularized linear regression.\n",
    "* For this question, fill the NAs with 0. \n",
    "* Try different values of `r` from this list: `[0, 0.000001, 0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 5, 10]`.\n",
    "* Use RMSE to evaluate the model on the validation dataset.\n",
    "* Round the RMSE scores to 2 decimal digits.\n",

    "### Question 5 \n",
    "\n",
    "* We used seed 42 for splitting the data. Let's find out how selecting the seed influences our score.\n",
    "* Try different seed values: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`.\n",
    "* For each seed, do the train/validation/test split with 60%/20%/20% distribution.\n",
    "* Fill the missing values with 0 and train a model without regularization.\n",
    "* For each seed, evaluate the model on the validation dataset and collect the RMSE scores. \n",
    "* What's the standard deviation of all the scores? To compute the standard deviation, use `np.std`.\n",
    "* Round the result to 3 decimal digits (`round(std, 3)`)\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: Standard deviation shows how different the values are.\n",
    "> If it's low, then all values are approximately the same.\n",
    "> If it's high, the values are different. \n",
    "> If standard deviation of scores is low, then our model is *stable*.\n",

    "### Question 6\n",
    "\n",
    "* Split the dataset like previously, use seed 9.\n",
    "* Combine train and validation datasets.\n",
    "* Fill the missing values with 0 and train a model with `r=0.001`. \n",
