    "> Note: sometimes your answer doesn't match one of the options exactly. That's fine. \n",
    "Select the option that's closest to your solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework, we will use the Car price dataset. Download it from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/master/chapter-02-car-price/data.csv).\n",
    "\n",
    "Or you can do it with `wget`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/master/chapter-02-car-price/data.csv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll keep working with the `MSRP` variable, and we'll transform it to a classification task. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Features\n",
    "\n",
    "For the rest of the homework, you'll need to use only these columns:\n",
    "\n",

    "### Data preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "* Select only the features from above and transform their names using next line:\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  data.columns = data.columns.str.replace(' ', '_').str.lower()\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "* Fill in the missing values of the selected features with 0.\n",
    "* Rename `MSRP` variable to `price`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the most frequent observation (mode) for the column `transmission_type`?\n",

    "- `DIRECT_DRIVE`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Create the [correlation matrix](https://www.google.com/search?q=correlation+matrix) for the numerical features of your dataset. \n",
    "In a correlation matrix, you compute the correlation coefficient between every pair of features in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the two features that have the biggest correlation in this dataset?\n",
    "\n",

    "- `highway_mpg` and `engine_cylinders`\n",
    "- `highway_mpg` and `city_mpg`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Make `price` binary\n",
    "\n",
    "* Now we need to turn the `price` variable from numeric into a binary format.\n",
    "* Let's create a variable `above_average` which is `1` if the `price` is above its mean value and `0` otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Split the data\n",
    "\n",
    "* Split your data in train/val/test sets with 60%/20%/20% distribution.\n",
    "* Use Scikit-Learn for that (the `train_test_split` function) and set the seed to `42`.\n",
    "* Make sure that the target value (`price`) is not in your dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "* Calculate the mutual information score between `above_average` and other categorical variables in our dataset. \n",
    "  Use the training set only.\n",
    "* Round the scores to 2 decimals using `round(score, 2)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which of these variables has the lowest mutual information score?\n",

    "- `vehicle_style`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "* Now let's train a logistic regression.\n",
    "* Remember that we have several categorical variables in the dataset. Include them using one-hot encoding.\n",
    "* Fit the model on the training dataset.\n",
    "    - To make sure the results are reproducible across different versions of Scikit-Learn, fit the model with these parameters:\n",
    "    - `model = LogisticRegression(solver='liblinear', C=10, max_iter=1000, random_state=42)`\n",
    "* Calculate the accuracy on the validation dataset and round it to 2 decimal digits.\n",

    "- 0.72\n",

    "\n",
    "### Question 5 \n",
    "\n",
    "* Let's find the least useful feature using the *feature elimination* technique.\n",
    "* Train a model with all these features (using the same parameters as in Q4).\n",
    "* Now exclude each feature from this set and train a model without it. Record the accuracy for each model.\n",
    "* For each feature, calculate the difference between the original accuracy and the accuracy without the feature. \n",
    "\n",
    "Which of following feature has the smallest difference?\n",

    "- `year`\n",
    "- `engine_hp`\n",

    "> **Note**: the difference doesn't have to be positive\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 6\n",
    "\n",
    "* For this question, we'll see how to use a linear regression model from Scikit-Learn.\n",
    "* We'll need to use the original column `price`. Apply the logarithmic transformation to this column.\n",
    "* Fit the Ridge regression model on the training data with a solver `'sag'`. Set the seed to `42`.\n",
    "* This model also has a parameter `alpha`. Let's try the following values: `[0, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10]`.\n",
    "* Round your RMSE scores to 3 decimal digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which of these alphas leads to the best RMSE on the validation set?\n",
    "\n",
    "- 0\n",
    "- 0.01\n",
    "- 0.1\n",
